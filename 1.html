    <p>Cinnamoroll is Cafe Cinnamon's official mascot. He is quite shy, but very friendly, and sometimes takes a nap on customers' laps. He can fly through the air by flapping his huge ears.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;">He is a little chubby shy male dog with white fur, blue eyes, pink cheeks, a plump and curly tail that resembles a cinnamon roll, and long ears that enable him to fly. Cinnamoroll is very sweet and always wants to help out his friends when they need it.</p>
